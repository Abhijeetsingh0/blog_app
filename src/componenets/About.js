        Hello,  I am Anshika Rao,  and I can help you to plan your garden! 
        I have been practicing gardening and organically food growing since 3 years or more.  
        Growing pure food and plants is the desire of my soul, 
        after learning to grow everything from local farmers , 
        now I am headed towards learning it professionally by pursuing hons. in agriculture from Bhopal.  
        <p>
        I did my first year with Bsc computer science but now I changed my stream to Agriculture.  
        I grow indoor pollution control plants,  
        and also some vegetables and food crops.  
        U can buy some vegetable seedlings right at my home.
